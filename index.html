                                <p>My friend, <a href="http://mattpic.com/" target="_blank">Matt Piccolella</a>, and I began working on this project last semester to help us learn the processes of designing and developing an app, as neither of us had any experience with creating native apps for the app store.</p>
                                <p>Last summer, we lived in SoHo, which allowed us to take advantage of spontaneous activities and events. Sometimes, though, we had feelings of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out" target="_blank">fomo</a> and frustration when we missed things we could have easily been at.</p>
                                <p>With that frustration, Radius was born as a way to discover and share spontaneous and little publicized events.</p>

                                <p class="bold">IDEATION</p>

                            <div class="right">
                                <p>It felt important that Radius be a map-centric app, as part of our frustration had come from a flaw of news feeds. Many of the things we imagine being posted on Radius would otherwise be posted on social networks like Facebook and Twitter, but there’s a good chance they'd get lost in our timelines and never seen.</p>
                                <p>The average Facebook user has more than 300 friends, and the average Twitter user follows more than 100 others. It’s difficult to cut through the noise, this almost inevitably results in scrolling past things you wish you hadn’t. Using markers on a map would allow us to show exact locations and provide users directions.</p>

                                <p>Mapping out the userflow allowed us to think more clearly about what functionality was essential to the app and figure out what features seemed excessive.</p>
                                <p>The first thing we cut was the ability to have friends. For our purposes, a user's profile only really served to attribute posts to someone like a user review platform, avoiding the headaches that come with anonymous posting.</p>
                                <p>Without friends, providing full public user profiles also seemed unnecessary. We wanted to include gamification with points, as well as offer users the ability to look through their own post history, but it felt unnecessary to have that visible to others.</p>

                                <p>We included a stream view, since some users might prefer a news feed style, and it would also help with high concentrations of posts in a small area. Switching to the stream view would display list of the posts currently visible in the user's map view.</p>
                                <p>Initially, it seemed like it would make sense for users to choose a range distance from their current location using a slider control. That would require locking users to their current location, though, so we decided keep familiar scroll and zoom gesture controls.</p>
                                <p>The icons for accessing the stream view and the profile/settings page were moved to the navigation bar.</p>

                            <p>Creating mocks with different color arrangements and styles allowed us to select that which felt most natural. Early on we had much more green throughout the app, but we decided it would be easier to read with white in general.</p>
                            <p>The green is used only for highlights and the navigation bar for the main pages, map view, stream view, and profile/settings. The add and detail pages have minimal green.</p>

                            <p>Both for the map preview and the stream view, we thought about showing the attached pictures in posts, even though we expect users to click through based on the descriptions.</p>
                            <p>We decided against including images from the stream view, as we felt that scroll/search velocity would be compromised unnecessarily with pictures.</p>

                                <p>Creating the process of adding a new post was the most difficult thing to do, as there was far too much going on. For example, early on we felt that sharing posts on other networks needed to be emphasized, but we decided users could just choose to share when taken to their new post.</p>
                                <p>The tricky part of the process remained choosing an expiration time for the post. Given the variety of posts we expect, ranging from all-day sales to street performances, it wouldn't be appropriate to set an arbitrary expiration time for the ephemeral posts.</p>

                            <p>Our solution was to ask the user to categorize their post (which also helps with filtering) and autogenerate a time which can be adjusted if necessary. We also are planning to create a time selector that includes options like "All Day," "All Week," and "This Evening," instead of just a number of hours.</p>
