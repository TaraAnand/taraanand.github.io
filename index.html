						<p>I am a PhD student at Columbia University in the Department of Biomedical Informatics, interested in using artificial intelligence and biomedical data for clinical phenotyping and predictive analysis.

	                <p>As a Computer Scientist intern at Adobe's headquarters in San Jose, I worked on a Digital Marketing team researching trends in image metadata information and developing an app to process image metadata from users' photo library to highlight significant images. </br></br></p>
	                <p>I also became involved in the community by serving as a mentor for the Girls Who Code Program hosted at Adobe and by speaking on the Women at Adobe's <a href = "https://spark.adobe.com/page/85oToKDZQkZOx/">Intern Panel</a>, reflecting on my internship experience and sharing advice for younger students who hope to pursue a career in tech or are interested in Computer Science.</br></p>

		            <p>At <a href = "https://gotechnica.org/">Technica</a>, the largest all-female hackathon, I worked on a team for the Research Track. The Virtual Try-On System Project is working to develop virtual animations to model clothing on figures. Images can be used to create 3D visualizations of an individual's body and different clothing of various sizes and textures can be modeled on the figure so someone can see how a clothing would realistically fit on them and move on their body. For our project, we were interested in investigating ways to decrease the data transmission time (since simulations are done on the cloud) by <a href = "https://github.com/TaraAnand/VirtualTryOnSystem">exploring different compressing/decompressing algorithms</a> designed specifically for the mesh data.

					<p>While interning with the New Castle Historical Society, I collected and consolidated data on historical landmarks in New Castle, New York. Using this data, I created an <a href = "http://www.newcastlehs.org/historic-new-castle/new-castle-landmarks/interactive-map/">online interactive map</a> , marking over 50 landmarks to increase awareness of local history and the importance of landmark preservation. </br> </br></p>
